# Custom Shell Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a simple custom shell in C for Linux platforms. The custom shell allows users to interact with the operating system, execute system commands, and supports basic features like running background processes, command piping, and redirection. It serves as a learning exercise for understanding how shells work and for exploring system-level programming in C.

## Features

- Executes basic commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, etc.)
- Supports input/output redirection (`>`, `<`)
- Supports piping (`|`)
- Handles background processes (using `&`)
- Provides a simple command prompt

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any standard C compiler

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-shell.git
   cd custom-shell
